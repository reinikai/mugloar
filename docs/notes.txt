Hello and welcome to your new job as Head of Dragon Resources Management of the ancient kingdom of Mugloar!

Every day knights take on brave, and frankly quite self-destructive, journeys to conquer our kingdom. This might be
because of the rumours of indescribably gorgeous princesses we started when we were bored.

Anyway, the relentless princess-snatching, dragon-slaying, tincan-dressed nuisances need to be stopped. The stopping
needs to be done effectively, which means we are going to have to use dragons. Studies by our kingdomâ€™s top scientists
show that dragons are the most efficient method to get rid of knights (and everything else except Drakie-Darling dragon
treats with spinach).

With great efficiency comes great cost however, dragons are not cheap pets, especially given their intense dislike
towards roasted spinach dragon treats, which your predecessor on the job already ordered a 3 year supply of. The dragons
enjoyed him a lot more than the treats mentioned before. To make up for the mistake of proposing vegetarian habits to
dragons and to keep our petkeeping costs in check, your task is to have a consistent dragon survival rate of at least
50%.

Our financial advisor Travis will be keeping a close eye on you. We have pretty solid proof that Travis was the one
responsible for the Great Paprika Mayonnaise Incident of 2014, so we would take him seriously if we were you, that was
some pretty nasty stuff.

As the weather in our kingdom can be pretty hectic, you should collaborate with the Royal Weather Service (Sponsored by
the Acid Rain Dance energy drink!) when planning your battles.

Here is their address: http://www.dragonsofmugloar.com/weather

Their responses might be a bit overwhelming and irrelevant to you at first, but forgive them, they do not specialise in
dragons but weather. You may find some dragon-related notes by your predecessor that can help you understand the
forecasts, although you might not want to take these too seriously, not only was the guy under the impression that
dragons would enjoy spinach, he also repurposed quite a few seagull nests as hats.

Mark's Top dragon tips !!!
Number 2 will *blow* your mind!

1) EVERYDAY REGULAR NORMAL WEATHER
- Normal weather = normal fights

2) STORM!
- Everyone DIES !!!

3) HEAVY RAIN WITH FLOODS
- Knights come by umbrellaboats
- Fire is useless in the rain
- Additional claw-sharpening is needed to destroy the umbrellaboats

4) THE LONG DRY
- Only the ZENNEST dragons who have achieved great balance of their inner-self through meditation and kite surfing can win battles during the drought!

5) FOG
- All dragons come with excellent knight-locating skills, no puny fog can change that
- The knights' dragon-locating skills, however, are limited to understanding whether or not they have already been eaten
