Dragons of Mugloar API

Create a program which:

1. Fetches new game from game API
2. Optionally fetches weather from "third party" weather API
3. Solves the game by selectively distributing 20 points on a dragon stats
4. Sends the response to solve API
5. Logs down results somehow
6. Repeat from step 1 specified amount of times

Task is considered acceptable when the application is reliably able to achieve battle success ratio above 60%
(higher the better). Once you are done:

1. Upload your accomplishment to version control
2. Send the link to cv@bigbank.ee
3. Wait for us to get back to you.
